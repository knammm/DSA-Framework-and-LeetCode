# Dynamic Programming

## Dynamic Programming is a method that allows us to solve problem that have certain properties:
- Optimal Substructure: Optimal solution of the whole problem can be obtain by optimal solution of its sub-problems.
- Overlapping Sub-problem.

## Step by step
- Defin objective function.
- Identify base cases.
- Recurrence relation.
- Order of computation.
- Location of the answer.
